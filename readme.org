* Integration Cpp with python


- register module from c++ file
- make sure project name and registered python module is the same for now.

  

* Look into cppimport python library which leverages pybind11

* What is the difference between unique and shared pointer?

- both are smart pointers
- both point to an object (allocated on the heap)

- for shared pointer, there may exist multiple pointers pointing to the same object
- for unique pointer this is not possible, only one pointer may point to object

- both will deallocate objext they point at if object can no longer be rerferenced
- difference is that object will be freed when last instance of shared pointer is destroyed



In test/, compile with cmake yielding a shared library.
In ext/, compile with setuptools to create a python module.
